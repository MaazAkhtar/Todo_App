# Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Zero Manual Code
All code must be generated by Claude Code/Spec-Kit Plus based on specs. No manual boilerplate or logic entry is allowed. This ensures consistency and adherence to spec-driven development practices.

### Spec-First Development
Every feature must be defined in the specs/ history folder before implementation. This creates clear traceability between requirements and code, ensuring all development is purposeful and well-documented.

### Clean Architecture
Maintain a modular Python structure with separation of CLI, Logic, and State layers to allow for future evolution into distributed systems. This promotes maintainability and scalability.

### Type Safety
Leverage Python 3.13+ features and strict typing for reliability. All functions must have proper type hints to prevent runtime errors and improve code clarity.

### Functional Scope Limitation
Focus on implementing exactly 5 core features only: Add, Delete, Update, View, and Mark Complete. This ensures a well-defined, manageable scope for Phase I.

### In-Memory State Management
Use in-memory storage only for Phase I (no external databases yet). This simplifies initial development while providing a clear path for future persistence layer implementation.

## Technology Standards

- **Language**: Python 3.13+ with strict typing
- **Dependency Management**: UV package manager
- **Code Quality**: PEP 8 compliance with docstrings for all functions
- **Testing**: Robust error handling for CLI inputs with comprehensive test coverage
- **Tooling**: Spec-driven workflow (Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation)

## Development Workflow

- All features must follow the Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation workflow
- Project structure must maintain /src for modularized Python source code and /specs for versioned history of all .md specification files
- Code changes must be traceable to corresponding specification files
- Environment must be fully reproducible using a single uv command

## Governance

This constitution governs all development activities for the Todo application project. All code changes, architectural decisions, and implementation approaches must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation and approval. All development work must reference this constitution to ensure consistency and adherence to spec-driven development practices.
