## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution

Project Constitution: The Evolution of Todo (Phase I)Project Goal: Build an in-memory Python CLI Todo application using a pure agentic workflow (Spec-driven development).Core PrinciplesZero Manual Code: All code must be generated by Claude Code/Spec-Kit Plus based on specs. No manual boilerplate or logic entry.Spec-First Development: Every feature must be defined in the specs/ history folder before implementation.Clean Architecture: Maintain a modular Python structure (separation of CLI, Logic, and State) to allow for future evolution into distributed systems.Type Safety: Leverage Python 3.13+ features and strict typing for reliability.Key StandardsWorkflow: Spec $\\rightarrow$ Plan $\\rightarrow$ Tasks $\\rightarrow$ Implementation.Tooling: Mandate usage of UV for dependency management and Python 3.13+.Project Structure: \* /src: Modularized Python source code./specs: Versioned history of all .md specification files.CLAUDE.md: Explicit instructions for Claude Code interactions.Code Quality: PEP 8 compliance, docstrings for all functions, and robust error handling for CLI inputs.Functional ConstraintsScope: 5 Core features only (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete).State: In-memory storage only for Phase I (no external databases yet).Interface: Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) with clear status indicators (e.g., \[X] for complete, \[ ] for incomplete).Identification: Tasks must be manageable via unique IDs.Success CriteriaTraceability: A clear link exists between every line of code and a corresponding specification file.Reproducibility: The environment can be fully initialized and run using a single uv command.Validation: All 5 core features are verified through the CLI without runtime crashes.

## Response snapshot

Constitution file created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the following content:

- Core Principles: Zero Manual Code, Spec-First Development, Clean Architecture, Type Safety, Functional Scope Limitation, In-Memory State Management
- Technology Standards: Python 3.13+, UV package manager, PEP 8 compliance
- Development Workflow: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation workflow
- Governance: Rules for constitution adherence and amendments

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational constitution document for the Todo application project
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with 55 lines
- 🔁 Next prompts: Can proceed with spec creation using /sp.specify
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution aligns with user requirements for spec-driven development approach

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin spec creation for Todo application features
